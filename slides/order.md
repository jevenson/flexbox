# order

defines the order in which elements appear in the browser <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

default is 0 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

does not actually manipulate DOM <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
- This does not actually manipulate the order in the DOM, so using this is not friendly for screen readers when content should follow a logical order
- Editing 2nd child
